## Security Overview

The Sentinel System employs a multi-layered defense strategy, incorporating:

### Defense in Depth
- **Authentication**: GitHub token validation.
- **Authorization**: Repository permission checks.
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive payload verification.
- **Process Isolation**: Sandboxed AI and Git operations.
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Manual approval for all code changes.

### Security Principles
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions.
- **Fail Secure**: Safe defaults and graceful degradation.
- **Defense Against Malicious Input**: Robust input validation.
- **Transparency**: Comprehensive audit trails.
- **Isolation**: Separate processing contexts.

## Authentication & Authorization

### GitHub Token Authentication

#### Token Requirements
GitHub tokens require specific scopes and repository permissions for the system to function correctly. Refer to the project's `config.py` for detailed requirements.

#### Token Validation
The system automatically validates GitHub tokens on startup and before processing requests to ensure they are active and have the necessary permissions.

### API Endpoint Protection

#### Token-Based Authentication
All protected API endpoints require a valid GitHub token for authentication.

#### Authorization Headers
Tokens must be provided in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`).

---

## Webhook Security

### Signature Verification

#### HMAC-SHA256 Verification
GitHub webhooks are secured using HMAC-SHA256 signatures. The system verifies these signatures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of incoming payloads.

#### Webhook Configuration Security
Proper GitHub webhook configuration is crucial, including setting a strong secret, enabling SSL verification, and limiting events to only those necessary (e.g., `Issues` only).

#### Secret Generation
Secure webhook secrets should be generated using strong cryptographic methods.

### Webhook Payload Validation

#### Event Filtering
The system processes only supported GitHub event types, rejecting all others.

#### Comprehensive Payload Validation
Incoming webhook payloads undergo thorough validation, including signature verification, JSON parsing, and repository matching, to prevent malicious or malformed data from being processed.

## GitHub Token Security

### Token Best Practices

#### Creation Guidelines
- Use fine-grained Personal Access Tokens with the least necessary privileges.
- Set expiration dates (recommended 90 days, max 1 year).
- Document the purpose of each token.

#### Storage Security
- **Production**: Store tokens in environment variables or secure secret management systems. Never commit them to repositories.
- **Development**: Use separate, short-lived tokens stored in `.env` files (excluded from Git).

#### Token Rotation
Regularly rotate GitHub tokens to minimize the risk of compromise.

### Permission Auditing
The system can audit GitHub token permissions and access to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.

---

## Network Security

### HTTPS Configuration

#### Production Deployment
Ensure HTTPS is enabled with valid SSL certificates for all production deployments. Implement security headers like HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection.

### CORS Configuration

#### Secure CORS Settings
Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow access only from trusted origins in production environments.

#### Development CORS Settings
More permissive CORS settings may be used during development for local testing.

### Rate Limiting

#### GitHub API Rate Limiting
The system includes mechanisms to handle GitHub API rate limits gracefully, preventing service interruptions due to excessive requests.

---

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

#### Data Classification
Data is classified into Public, Sensitive, and Confidential categories to guide appropriate handling and protection measures.

#### Data Sanitization
Sensitive information is sanitized or redacted before logging or displaying to prevent accidental exposure.

### Encryption at Rest

#### Log File Protection
Log files are secured with appropriate file permissions and can be encrypted to protect sensitive data at rest.

#### Configuration File Security
Environment and configuration files containing sensitive information are secured with strict file permissions and can be encrypted for production deployments.

---

## Input Validation

### Webhook Payload Validation

#### Comprehensive Validation
All incoming webhook payloads are rigorously validated using Pydantic models to ensure data integrity and prevent injection attacks.

### API Input Validation

#### Parameter Validation
API endpoints validate all input parameters, including feedback, priority, state, and labels, using Pydantic fields and validators to enforce data types, formats, and constraints.

### Command Injection Prevention

#### Safe Subprocess Execution
System commands are executed securely using a controlled executor that whitelists allowed commands and subcommands, preventing command injection vulnerabilities.

---

## Process Isolation

### Background Task Security

#### Isolated Processing
Background tasks, especially those involving AI or Git operations, are processed in isolated environments (e.g., separate processes or threads) to limit their access to the main application state and network.

### File System Security

#### Restricted File Access
File operations are restricted to allowed directories and file types, preventing directory traversal and unauthorized file access. Temporary workspaces are created with secure permissions.

---

## Audit & Monitoring

### Security Logging

#### Comprehensive Security Events
The system logs security-relevant events, including authentication attempts, webhook events, and security violations, with detailed information for auditing and incident response.

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Health Check Security
A comprehensive health check includes security-focused checks such as GitHub token validity, webhook secret configuration, SSL/TLS status, and file permissions.

### Security Metrics

#### Key Security Metrics
Key security metrics, such as webhook signature verification status, authentication attempts, and detected security violations, are tracked for continuous monitoring and analysis.

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Security Checklist
A checklist of security measures to be verified before deployment, covering infrastructure, authentication, input validation, monitoring, and code security.

### Production Security Configuration
A script or guidelines for configuring production security settings, including file permissions, webhook secret generation, and critical security setting validation.

---

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Response Plan
A structured plan for responding to security incidents, covering detection, analysis, containment, mitigation, investigation, recovery, and lessons learned.

### Emergency Contacts and Procedures
A list of emergency contacts and an escalation matrix for security incidents, along with communication channels.

## Conclusion

Security is an ongoing process. Regular review and updates of these measures are essential, adapting to evolving threats, new vulnerabilities, and changes in the system.

### Regular Security Tasks
A schedule of regular security tasks, including daily monitoring, weekly audits, monthly credential rotation, and quarterly security drills.

Remember: **Security is everyone's responsibility**. Stay vigilant, keep systems updated, and always follow the principle of least privilege.
